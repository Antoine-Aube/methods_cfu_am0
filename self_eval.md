# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I really enjoyed playing around with new methods, researching them, and becoming more comfortable with explaining the process with more technical language. 

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

you can essentially repeat the action without having to write lots of code! You often want to perform the same action on different objects, or different instances of the same object. It's effecient to use methods instead of typing out code for each instance.
